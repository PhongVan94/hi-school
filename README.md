## ‚≠ê Introduction

**Introducing the High School Simulation Project with Spring Boot in the Web Field for Vietnam**

Welcome to the High School Simulation Project, a purely academic and research-focused initiative, aimed at exploring the potential of technology in the context of high school education in Vietnam through web applications. This simplified project, powered by the robust Spring Boot framework, serves as a research tool to understand and uncover the capabilities of technology in enhancing the educational experience within the web domain.

In an era where educational technology is advancing rapidly, our project aims to provide insights and learning opportunities within the web application development for education. While it may not possess the complexity of a complete application, it represents a significant step in the academic journey to explore the creative use of web technology to improve the quality of education.

This introduction marks the beginning of a research-driven journey through the High School Simulation Project in Vietnam within the web application development field. Join us as we explore how web technology can influence and enhance the educational experience in the Vietnamese context.

Welcome to a research-driven vision of the future of high school education in Vietnam in the web development field. Welcome to the High School Simulation Project powered by Spring Boot.
